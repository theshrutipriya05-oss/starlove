<h1>You always end up here ✨</h1>

<p>
No matter which path you chose,  
it brought you here.  
Just like every NEET day — even the messy ones —  
is quietly taking you closer to your dream.
</p>

<p>
You don’t need to be perfect.  
You just need to keep showing up.  
And you are doing that, beautifully.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere, someone is proud of you.  
Someone believes in you.  
Someone wants to see you in that white coat.
</p>

<p>
You are not alone in this universe.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">
🌷 Always here for you.
